 VARIABLES:

Variables are Containers for Storing Data

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

    Automatically
    Using var
    Using let
    Using const
In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.
ex:
    x stores the value 5
    y stores the value 6
    z stores the value 11
note;
The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

js LET:
The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with let have Block Scope

Variables declared with let must be Declared before use

Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope
Block Scope

Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.

These two keywords provideed Block Scope in JavaScript
Global Scope

Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.

Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope
Cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.


The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned

Variables defined with const have Block Scope

Operator 	Example 	Same As
= 	         x = y 	       x = y
+= 	         x += y        x = x + y
-= 	         x -= y        x = x - y
*= 	         x *= y        x = x * y
/= 	         x /= y        x = x / y
%= 	         x %= y        x = x % y
**= 	         x **= y       x = x ** y
